/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An implementation of the classic Pac-Man ghost Speedy.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Nickname: Pinky. Speedy gets his name for an unusual reason. Speedy appears
 * to try to outsmart Pac-Man and crash into Pac-Man from the opposite
 * direction. The truth behind this is that when Speedy isn't patrolling the
 * top-left corner of the maze, he tries to attack Pac-Man by moving to where he
 * is going to be (that is, a few spaces ahead of Pac-Man's current direction)
 * instead of right where he is, as Blinky does. It's difficult to use this to
 * your advantage, but it's possible. If Pinky is coming at you and you face a
 * different direction, even briefly, he may just turn away and attempt to cut
 * you off in the new direction while you return to your original direction. In
 * the original Japanese version, his name is Machibuse/Pinky.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;AI:&lt;/b&gt; When the ghosts are not patrolling their home corners, Pinky wants
 * to go to the place that is four grid spaces ahead of Pac-Man in the direction
 * that Pac-Man is facing. If Pac-Man is facing down, Pinky wants to go to the
 * location exactly four spaces below Pac-Man. Moving towards this place uses
 * the same logic that Blinky uses to find Pac-Man's exact location. Pinky is
 * affected by a targeting bug if Pac-Man is facing up - when he moves or faces
 * up, Pinky tries moving towards a point up, and left, four spaces.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;i&gt;Note: In the original arcade series, the ghosts' genders are unspecified
 * and assumed to be male. In 1999, the USA division of Namco and Namco Hometech
 * developed the Pac-Man World series and declared Pinky to be female.&lt;/i&gt;
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
